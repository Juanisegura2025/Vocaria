## üéØ **CORE DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES**

### **‚úÖ PROVEN WINNERS (Keep Always)**

#### **üîß Development Workflow**
- **Always prefer simple solutions** - Complexity is the enemy of stability
- **Look for existing code to iterate on instead of creating new code** - Build on proven foundations
- **Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task** - Avoid scope creep and unrelated changes
- **Keep the codebase very clean and organized** - Maintainability over cleverness
- **Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code** - Refactor when hitting this threshold

#### **üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Security**  
- **Never overwrite .env file without first asking and confirming** - Critical for environment security
- **Write code that takes into account different environments: dev, test, and prod** - Environment-aware development
- **Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects dev or prod environments** - Keep test data in tests only

#### **üé® Code Quality**
- **Avoid duplication of code whenever possible** - BUT only after patterns are proven stable
- **Write thorough tests for all major functionality** - Quality assurance is non-negotiable
- **You are careful to only make changes that are requested or well understood** - Precision over assumptions

## üîÑ **EVOLVED RULES (Improved from Experience)**

#### **üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Patterns**
- **Prefer existing patterns, but allow simple new patterns for proven stability** *(Modified)*
  - OLD: "Do not introduce new patterns without exhausting existing options"
  - NEW: Balance between consistency and pragmatic solutions
  - EXAMPLE: Tailwind utilities over custom CSS when custom classes cause conflicts

- **Avoid major changes to proven patterns unless explicitly instructed** *(Refined)*
  - Apply after features show stability (not during initial development)
  - Allow iterative improvements on working foundations

#### **üñ•Ô∏è Server Management**
- **Restart servers only for dependency, environment, or configuration changes** *(Optimized)*
  - OLD: "Always restart server after changes"  
  - NEW: Trust hot reload for code changes, restart only when necessary
  - SAVES: Development time and maintains flow state

#### **üîÑ Bug Fixing Strategy**
- **When fixing issues, exhaust existing implementation options first** *(Clarified)*
  - If new patterns are needed, remove old implementation afterward
  - Document the reasoning for pattern changes
  - Ensure no duplicate logic remains

## üÜï **CRITICAL NEW RULES (Gaps Filled)**

### **üé® Styling & Design**
- **For styling: Prefer Tailwind utilities + inline styles over custom CSS classes until patterns are proven stable**
  - REASON: Custom CSS classes can cause import/layout conflicts
  - APPROACH: Start functional ‚Üí identify patterns ‚Üí extract components
  - EXAMPLE: `style={{background: 'linear-gradient(...)'}}` over `.custom-gradient`

- **When making design changes, make incremental changes and test each step**
  - One visual change at a time
  - Validate in browser before proceeding
  - Commit working states frequently

- **Preserve working functionality when making visual improvements**
  - Visual polish should never break existing features
  - Test critical user flows after styling changes
  - Rollback specific elements if functionality breaks

### **üß© Component Architecture**
- **When extracting components, ensure TypeScript types are properly defined upfront**
  - REASON: Import/export errors are harder to debug later
  - INCLUDE: Props interfaces, proper exports, type safety
  - VALIDATE: Import works before moving to next feature

- **Always verify imports/exports work before moving to next feature**
  - Test component imports in browser
  - Check for TypeScript errors
  - Validate no circular dependencies

- **For auth and core functionality, prioritize functional over beautiful until baseline is established**
  - Get it working reliably first
  - Add premium styling after stability proven
  - Separate concerns: functionality vs. aesthetics

### **üîß Debugging & Rollback Strategy**
- **When debugging styling issues, isolate to specific CSS/component before broad changes**
  - Don't change multiple styling systems simultaneously
  - Use browser DevTools to identify specific issues
  - Test fixes incrementally

- **Use git rollback for specific files rather than full project rollbacks**
  - `git checkout HEAD -- specific/file.tsx` over full project reset
  - Preserve working parts while fixing broken parts
  - Document what was rolled back and why

- **For complex UI changes, break into smaller commits for easier rollback**
  - One feature per commit
  - Descriptive commit messages
  - Tag stable states for easy reference

### **üìä Performance & Quality**
- **Always maintain consistent spacing and visual hierarchy when making design changes**
  - Use design system tokens consistently
  - Respect established spacing patterns
  - Validate responsive behavior

- **Test critical user flows after each major styling change**
  - Login/logout flow
  - Navigation between pages  
  - Form submissions
  - API integrations

- **Document component props and usage patterns when extracting reusable components**
  - Clear TypeScript interfaces
  - Usage examples in comments
  - Props validation where appropriate

---

## üö® **CRITICAL DON'TS (Learned from Pain)**

### **‚ùå Styling Pitfalls**
- **DON'T:** Create complex custom CSS class hierarchies without proven need
- **DON'T:** Mix multiple styling approaches in single component without clear strategy
- **DON'T:** Override Antd styling without understanding cascading effects
- **DON'T:** Change entire design system when single component issue exists

### **‚ùå Component Architecture Pitfalls**  
- **DON'T:** Extract components prematurely before patterns are clear
- **DON'T:** Create component abstractions that are harder to debug than inline code
- **DON'T:** Ignore TypeScript errors during component development
- **DON'T:** Create component dependencies that cause circular imports

### **‚ùå Development Flow Pitfalls**
- **DON'T:** Make large architectural changes without clear rollback plan
- **DON'T:** Modify multiple core systems simultaneously
- **DON'T:** Skip testing after "small" changes that affect user flows
- **DON'T:** Ignore console errors even if functionality appears to work

## üîÑ **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (Best Practices)**

### **1. Starting New Features**
```
1. Understand existing codebase patterns
2. Start with simplest possible implementation  
3. Get it working functionally first
4. Test core functionality thoroughly
5. Commit working baseline
6. Add styling/polish incrementally
7. Extract reusable patterns after proven stability
```

### **2. Debugging Issues**
```
1. Identify specific broken component/function
2. Check browser console for exact errors
3. Use git to isolate when issue was introduced
4. Fix one issue at a time
5. Test fix before moving to next issue
6. Use specific rollbacks, not full project resets
```

### **3. Making Design Changes**
```
1. Preserve working functionality as base
2. Make one visual change at a time
3. Test in browser immediately
4. Use design system tokens consistently
5. Commit working visual improvements
6. Extract patterns after multiple uses proven
```

### **4. Component Development**
```
1. Define TypeScript interfaces first
2. Implement basic functionality
3. Test imports/exports work correctly
4. Add error handling and edge cases
5. Document props and usage patterns
6. Test in multiple contexts before extraction
```

## üîç **DEBUGGING DECISION TREE**

### **When Something Breaks:**
```
1. IS IT A STYLING ISSUE?
   ‚Üí Check browser DevTools console
   ‚Üí Look for CSS conflicts or missing imports
   ‚Üí Test with inline styles to isolate problem
   ‚Üí Use specific git rollback for styling files

2. IS IT A COMPONENT IMPORT ERROR?
   ‚Üí Check TypeScript errors in terminal
   ‚Üí Verify export/import syntax
   ‚Üí Test component isolation
   ‚Üí Rollback component files specifically

3. IS IT AN API/BACKEND ISSUE?
   ‚Üí Check network tab in DevTools
   ‚Üí Verify server is running on correct port
   ‚Üí Test API endpoints with curl
   ‚Üí Check backend logs for errors

4. IS IT A GENERAL FUNCTIONALITY BREAK?
   ‚Üí Identify last working commit
   ‚Üí Use git bisect to find breaking change
   ‚Üí Test incremental rollbacks
   ‚Üí Isolate specific broken functionality
```

## üìö **REFERENCES & EXAMPLES**

### **Successful Patterns:**
- **Auth Flow Development:** Functional baseline ‚Üí visual polish ‚Üí component extraction
- **Design System Implementation:** CSS variables ‚Üí utilities ‚Üí components
- **Error Recovery:** Specific file rollbacks ‚Üí incremental fixes ‚Üí stable state

### **Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **Premature Component Extraction:** Led to import/export complexity

- **Custom CSS Class Overuse:** Created styling conflicts and maintenance burden

### **Tools & Commands:**
```bash
# Specific file rollback
git checkout HEAD -- path/to/specific/file.tsx

# Tag stable states  
git tag v[version]-[milestone]

# Check TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Validate design system
getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--primary')
```
